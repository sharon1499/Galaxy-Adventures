# Galaxy-Adventures
My game is a pretty simple space themed layout. In this game the player is given the story line of what their character is and what his/her mission is. The mission is to travel around the galaxy to each planet and discover if life has existed on it. If life has existed on the planet there would be a person(alien) who will give the player a riddle to solve. The riddle is used as a way for the player to find a place located on the planet. Within that place will be a item that hints that life has exited on that planet. On some other planets there are no riddles or aliens but there are items located on there that can be examined but not taken. The main objective is to collect all of the items obtained from solving the riddles and bring them back to earth as evidence
